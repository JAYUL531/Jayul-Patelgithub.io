# Jayul-Patelgithub.io
This is my personal website created using GitHub Pages. It's a simple, responsive website showcasing my projects, skills, and achievements. The source code is available on my GitHub, and the site is built with HTML, CSS, and optionally JavaScript for interactions. GitHub Pages helps me keep my site live without needing a paid hosting service.
